# AI-Driven-Application-For-Diabetes-Care: Predictive-Analayis-and-Personalized-Recommendations

## Description
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. It includes data collection, preprocessing, model development, evaluation and real-time user-friendly interface.

## Abstract
This project stands out in the realm of data mining for diabetes prediction by integrating advanced sampling techniques and optimization of classification algorithms to address the critical challenge of class imbalance - a prevalent issue often overlooked in standard predictive models. Enhanced model sensitivity and precision through targeted data preprocessing and the strategic use of SMOTE, ADASYN, and RandomOverSampler with ensemble and classification classifiers. This method not only improves detection rates of diabetic cases, as evidenced by our enhanced recall and F1 scores but also reduces the risk of false positives, a crucial aspect in medical diagnostics. This comprehensive and balanced approach ensures the model's superiority in both predicting diabetes accurately and ensuring the model's applicability in real-world clinical settings.

Application also incorporates a real-time user-friendly interface allowing for immediate, personalized risk assessments in predicting diabetes and health advice that provides tailored dietary and lifestyle recommendations, enhancing user engagement and promoting proactive health management.
